Globalization
=============

In many ways, Capitalism/Globalization/Neoliberalization has produced results
worth praising. However, it's success may come at the expense of eating the
base upon which it rests.

> The market for labor pressures people to mvoe around the globe to where they
> can earn the most, creating strangers in a strange land.

> The market's undermining of social order threatens to destroy the very
> societal and institutional structures on which the markey economy rests.
