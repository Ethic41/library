Principles
===

> Principles are ways of successfully dealing with the laws of nature or the laws of life. Those who know more of them and understand them well know how to interact with the world more effectively that those who know fewer of them or know them less well.

The Importance of Principles
---

**What are Principles?**
Values are what you consider important. Principles are what allow you to live a life consistent with those values. Principles connect values to actions.

**Why are they important?**
Without principles, you are forced to react to circumstances without considering what you value most, and how to make choices to get what you want.

**Where do principles come from?**
Roll your own, Religious, or Legal principles are common. Adopting pre-packaged principles without thinking about them exposes you to the risk of inconsistency with your values.

Your principles need to reflect values you really believe in.

**Do you have principles that you live your life by? What are they?**
*What do you value most deeply?*

**How well do you think they work, and why?**

Dalio's Fundamental Life Principles
---

> In order to be motivated, I needed to work for what I wanted, not for what other people wanted me to do. And in order to be successful, I needed to figure out for myself how to get what I wanted, not remember the facts I was being told to remember.

1. Work for what you want, not what others want you to do.
2. Come up with the best independent opinion you can.
3. Stress test those opinions by having the smartest people one can find challenge them.
4. Remain wary about overconfidence, and figure out how to deal with not knowing.
5. Wrestle with realities, reflect on the decisions made, learn from them and improve.

*Dalio meditates.*

> I learned that failure is by and large due to not accepting and successfully dealing with the realities of life, and that achieving success is simply a matter of accepting and successfully dealing with all my realities.

> I learned that finding out what is true, regardless of what that is, including all the stuff most people think is bad -- like mistakes and personal weaknesses -- is good because I can then deal with these things so that they don't stand in my way.

> I learned that there is nothing to fear from truth. While some truths can be scary, knowing them allows us to deal with them better. Being truthful, and letting others be completely truthful, allows me and others to fully explore our thoughts and exposes us to the feedback that is essential for our learning.

> I learned that being truthful was an extension of my freedom to be me. I believe that people who are one way on the inside and believe that they need to be another way outside to please others become conflicted and often lose touch with what they really think and feel. It's difficult for them to be happy and almost impossible for them to be be at their best.

> I learned that I want the people I deal with to say what they really believe and to listen to what others say in reply, in order to find out what is true. I learned that one of the greatest sources of problems in our society arises from people having loads of wrong theories in their heads - oftehn theories that are critical of others - that they won't test by speaking to the releant people about them. Instead, they talk behind people's backs, which leads to pervasive misinformation. I learned to hate this because I could see that making judgements about people so that they are tried and sentenced in your head, without asking them for their perspective, is both unethical and unproductive. So I learned to loe real integrity and to despise the lack of it.

> I learned that everyone makes mistakes and has weaknesses and that one of the most important things that differentiates people is their approach to handling them. I learned that there is an incredible beauty to mistakes, because embedded in each mistake is a puzzle, and a gem that I could get if I soled it. I learned that each mistake was probably a reflection of something that I was doing wrong, so if I could figure out what that was, I could learn how to be more effectie. I learned that wrestling with my problems, mistakes, and weaknesses was the training that strengthened me. Also, I learned that it was the pain of this wrestling that made me and those around me appreciate our successes.

**Fundamental Principles**
> Success is achieed by people who deeply understand reality and know how to use it to get what they want.

*Truth, more precisely, an accurate understanding of reality, is the essential foundation for producing good outcomes.*

Good means operating consistently with natural laws. Bad, the converse.

> 2. Evolution, which is the natural movement toward adaptation, is the greatest single force in the universe, and that it is good.
> 3. The desire to evolve is humanity's most pervasive driving force.

The things we are striving for are just the bait to get us to chase after them in order to make us evolve. It is the evolution and not the reward itself that matters to us and those around us.

> 4. Pursuing self-interest in harmony with the laws of the universe and contributing to evolution is universally rewarded.

There is an excellent correlation between giving society what it wants and making money, and almost no correlation between the desire to make money and how much money one makes.

> 5. The most important quality that differentiates successful people from unsuccessful people is our capacity to learn and adapt to these things.

Most people don't like reflecting on their weaknesses even though recognizing them is an essential step toward preventing them from causing problems.

> 6. The quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions we make.

**Reality + Dreams + Determination = A successful life**

Happiness is much more determined by how things turn out relative to their expectations rather than the absolute level of their conditions.
