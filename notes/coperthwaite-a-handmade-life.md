A Handmade Life: In Search of Simplicity
========================================
William Coperthwaite

> My central concern is encouragement - encouraging people to see, to experiment, to plan, to create, and to dream. If enough people do this, we will find a better way.

> Aesthetics are central to the curriculum, since beauty is a birthright, and the lack of beauty is a sign of great danger.

> I was not concerned with what economic, political, or social system is best. I was concerned with education - the development of human beings, their growth.

> How we live is fundamentally a political act.

> In a false democracy, individuals become only spectators to their own experience and to the wider intellectural, civic, and social life around them.

> The work of creating a new society 'can only be accomplished through citizen action, not' by specialists, but by the people themselves to fit their needs.

That in particular seems to resonate with Alexander and Segal's beliefs.

> If we feel endangered by meaninglessness, then one is under an obligation to refuse meaningless pleasures and to resist meaningless work, and to give up the moral comfort and the excuses of the moral comfort and the excuses of the mentality of specialization. - Wendall Berry

> We need not more disciples but more apprentices.

Apprenticeship involves improving upon what was learned.

> At every crossway on the road that leads to the future, each progressive spirit is opposed by a thousand men appointed to guard the past. Let us have no fear lest the fair towers of former days be sufficiently defended. The least that the most timid among us can do is not to add to the immense dead weight which nature drags along.
> Let us not say to ourselves that the best truth always lies in moderation, in the decent average. This would perhaps be so if the majority of men did not think on a much lower plane than is needful. That is why it behooves others to think and hope on a higher plane than seems reasonable. The average, the decent moderation of today, will be the least human of things tomorrow. At the time of the Spanish Inquisition, the opinion of good sense and of the good medium was certainly that people ought not to burn too large a number of heretics; extreme and unreasonable opinion obviously demanded that they should burn none at all.
> Let us think of the great invisible ship that carries our human destinies upon eternity. Like the vessels of our confined oceans, she has her sails and her ballast. The fear that she may pitch or roll on leaving the road-stead is no reason for increasing the weight of the ballast by stowing the fair white sails in the depths of the hold. They were not woven to molder side by side with cobblestones in the dark. Ballast exists everywhere; all the pebbles of the harbor, all the sand of the beach, will serve for that. But sails are rare and precious things; their place is not in the murk of the well, but amid the light of the tall masts, where they will collect the winds of space. - Maeterlinck

> The finest design for society will not be one worked up by specialists but a design created by the people themselves to fit their needs.

Again, echoing Alexander + Segal.

> Good design would mean allocating our money and prestige to people rather than buildings and gadgetry.

> It is these little elements multiplied many times over that make up our daily world. The impact of subtleties upon the quality of life and work is incalculable. (10)

Alexander again; particularly the recursive property of wholeness.

> The end result of a better world will be as much a consequence of the process of seeking as it is an outcome of specific design ideas. (10)

> Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful. - William Morris

> The chair is the decoration. - Peter Denko

> True beauty must be as pleasing to the mind as to the eye.

> That which is not a necessity is an encumbrance. - Nomad saying

> I wanted no part in the common prostitutions whereby muscle, brains, or talent are sold for the wherewithal to pursue personal goals in spare time.

> What is the value of having having equal rights to mediocrity? (70)

> Not that we shouldn't use a stoone, but we should use whatever we use with reverence, with concern for its nature, beauty, and spirit. (75)

> How we produce is at least as important as what we produce. (97)
