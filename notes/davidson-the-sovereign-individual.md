8: The End of Egalitarian Economics
-----

- Changes in the economy/military alter the structure of society, distributions of wealth, and the power of groups.
- The Information Age will entail a societal reorganization.
- Location is becoming less important. Organizations that operate within geographic boundaries will play a diminished role in the future.
- The distribution of earning capacity will change significantly. A shift to a power law.
- Tech serves to accentuate, rather than mask, the differences in human talents and motivations.

It's interesting to note that the authors feel that less violence leads to greater elitism and less egalitarianism. Egalitarianism causes normalization.

The distribution of society is best described as a turnip, where the bottoms and tops of society taper off, as opposed to the standard idea of a social pyramid. Average is normal. The nature of the Information Age is resulting in the disappearance of a large segment of low and middle skill employment.

*As the economies of more countries deeply assimilate information technology, they will see the emergence of a more or less unemployable underclass... This will lead to a reaction with a nationalist, antitechnology bias.*

*The societies of the twenty-first century are likely to be more unequal than those we have lived in during the twentieth.*

*The deflation of compulsion as a feature of economic life will allow producers to retain assets that heretofore have been seized and redistributed. Redistribution usually meant that assets were dragooned into lower-value uses, thus reducing the productivity of capital. Wealth taken disproportionally from persons who were most adept at investing resources was reallocated by politicians to those who were less adept. In most cases, redistributed income was employed in lower-order economics activities. The effects of freeing resources will vary greatly among jurisdictions. This freezing of resources will bankrupt welfare states, and enhance diseconomies to scale that are undermining large goverments and all institutions subsidized by large governments. On the other hand, the shift to the cybereconomy will reduce the economic drawbacks suffered by people operating under sovereignties in regions that have traditionally suffered from the inability to organize on a large scale.*

*The Information Revolution will make it much less important whether governments are able to function capably. It will therefore be easier for persons living in traditionally poor countries to surmount the hurdles that their governments have heretofore placed in the path of economic growth.*

*The market paradigm presupposes that results can be better regulated by rewarding desirable outcomes and penalizing undesirable ones. To be poor is undesirable, and to become rich is desirable. Therefore, incentives should reward wealth creation and encourage people to pay for the resources they consume. Life is more 'fair' when people get to keep more of what they earn.
