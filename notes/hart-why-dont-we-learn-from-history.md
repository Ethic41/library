Why Don't We Learn From History?
================================

B. H. Liddell Hart

> History can show we what to avoid, even if it does not each us what to do.

> It is a romantic habit to ascribe to a flash of inspiration in battle what more truly has been due to seeds long sown.

> Direct experience is inherently too limited to form an adequate foundation either for theory or application. At the best it produces as atmosphere that is of value in drying and heardening the structure of thought.

> Nothing can deceive like a document.

> Where there is selection there is art.

> I can conceive of no finer ideal of a man's life than to face life with clear eyes.

> Those who are disloyal to their own superiors are most prone to preach loyalty to their subordinates.

> Loyalty is a noble quality, so long as it is not blind and does not exclude the higher loyalty to truth and decency.

> The pretence to infallibility is instinctive in a hierarchy.

> The duty of the food citizen who is free from the responsibility of government is to be a watchdog upon it, lest government impair the fundamental objects which it exists to serve.

> [Democracy], by its nature, it prefers those who keep step with the slowest march of thought and frowns on those who may disturb the 'conspiracy for mutual efficiency'. Thereby, this system of government tends to result in the triumph of mediocrity, and entails the exclusion of first-rate ability if this is combined with honesty. But the alternative to it, despotism, almost always means the triumph of stupidy.

Does the blockchain address this shortcoming? Is democracy necessary if transactions are independently verifiable by anyone curious?

> Bad means lead to no good end.

> It is not possible to make men do something without risking more than is gained from the compelled effort.

> [Conscription] sustained the fetish of mere numbers at a time when skill and enthusiasm were becoming ever more necessary.

> Our tradition of individual freedom is the slow-ripening fruit of centuries of effort. To surrender it within after fighting to defend it against dangers without would be the supreme irony of our history.

> The surer way of achieving progress is by generating and diffusing the thought of improvement.

> Expediency has rarely proven expedient.

> What is the use of anyone sacrificing himself to preserve the country unless in the hope, and with the idea, of providing a chance to continue its spiritual progress toward becoming a better country? Otherwise he is merely helping to preserve the husk, saving the form but not the soul.

> Any constructive effort, and all human relations, personal, political, and commercial, depend on being able to depend on promises.

Again, blockchain.

> How can we hope to rid the world of war until we have cured ourselves of the originating causes?

> The validity of treaties depend on mutual convenience.

> Where unification has been able to establish unity of ideas, it has usually ended in uniformity, paralyzing the growth of new ideas.

> With hearts, a temporary change is easier than with habits, but a profound and permanant change is far more difficult.

> If we take care of the means, the end will take care of itself.

> Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
