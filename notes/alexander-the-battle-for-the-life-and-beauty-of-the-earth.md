The Battle for the Life and Beauty of the Earth
===============================================
Christopher Alexander

> The purpose of all architecture, the purpose of its spatial-geometric organization, is to provide opportunities for life-giving situations. (1)

> The quality of buildings depends entirely on the ability to support human life, especially its inner, and emotional respects, to allow human existence to have depth of meaning, to give people the fullest ability to express and exhaust the potentialities of which they are capable. (4)

> Buildings must be concieved as support systems for human feeling and social feeling. (5)

> Occasional pastiches or faked copies of old-time buildings stand pathetically, but fool no one, and lack, entirely, the strength, gusto, and determination of the real thing. (5)

> To find a new way forward that moves us toward an environment and atmosphere in which all people are genuinely support, we need something radically different from our contemporary professional activities. (6)

Move beyond making $ to spend on ourselves. How can we support the social fabric we're a part of.

> The wholeness, which badly needs to be emphasized, is lost among the disparate and disconnected categories. (7)

> With current construction processes, buildings no longer have the possibility of local adaptation. (44)

> [System A]: Creation and production are organic in character, and are governed by human judgements that emanate from the underlying wholeness of situations, conditions, and surroundings. (49)

> [System B]: the production is thought of as mechanical. (49)

> System A finds the 'real'. System B replaces the real, and does not so easily allow us to evaluate things on the basis of the reality of feeling. (54)

> A state of mind which takes the land as holy, and tries to extend and increase that holiness, in every act. (54)

> It deliberately pushes those monetary considerations away, in order to make room for these other, much more significant considerations. (60)

> Buildings, neighborhoods, and communities are today most often considered as commodities. They are made to be bought and sold and hired out. (75)

> The physical-ecological, and the mental-emotional-social cannot be separated. (86)

> Wholeness is a structure, and can be understood as such. (88)

> The feeling or the intuition, of what the wholeness is - always extends beyond the thing in question. (88)

> **Somehow, any wholeness we want to point to, or think about, seems to elude comprehension... The intangible comes from the fact that everything that has, or maintains wholeness, is always unique. This means that words and concepts always fail to encompass it perfectly. Only the wholeness itself can point to what it is.** (88)

> [A procedural definition of wholeness:] A general specification for a process that is capable of increasing wholeness is an a domain, and particularly in the physical domain where something, some place, some part of the world is being built, or repaired, or conceived. (89)

> The whole community becomes an emotional-ecological system that maintains itself, intensifies its own life, and can enhance the lives of individuals. (90)

> Wholeness, in the large, is created by many smaller wholes, at a wide variety of identifiable scales. (92)

> [System A:] the ordinary way.

> If the ordinary thing is to be done in the ordinary way, no word is necessary. - Hosoi (112)

> The importantance of the client, and the absolute need for the clients wise vision, is fundamental to every project and to its success. - Hosoi (114)

Start with a draft. Collect ideas, consolidate them, see how the fit with the reality of the situation. Iterate.

The agile method is fantastic for building software that's already well conceptualized and thought through. Alexander's pattern language list construction remains a critical part of the initial design process however. (Reminds me of something the Clojure guy mentioned about architecting projects. Agile isn't an excuse not to think.)

Entrances, not just as physical constructs, but as mechanisms to affect our mental state.

Why aren't we, as adults, forming communities as universities, as sites for self-growth, and the acquisition of wisdom? Why stagnate. Why stop learning?

The importance of connecting between structures. Isolation/atomization is lifeless.

> Each of these five College departments has its own garden. (138)

^^ !!

> We imagine that the building is sitting among large trees which make it feel sheltered and appropriate, the way large farm buildings are surrounded by trees in the middle of wide open fields. (139)

> We must find a way in which the system of centers defined by the pattern-language can be placed, so that it enhances, preserves, and extends the system of centers which is already in the land. (173)

> The essence of System B is that it works with abstractions. Plans are abstract. Money is abstract. The process of construction is abstract. Negotiations are abstract. Reality itself is abstract. There are no feelings, no truly human events, only calculations, ink, and paper.

> The essence of System A, on the other hand, is that it is real. (185)

> It is the positive, outdoor spaces above all, which give us pleasure, and which give us our attachment to the land. (197)

> The appearance of symmetry in nature comes about because there is a symmetry of the conditions where the thing in question exists. (204)

> Some 200 models were used to build Eishin. hey convey the range, size, roughness, and charm of our models... yet the models were all made rapidly, sometimes in minutes, never more than hours. (217)

> The lack of perfection he accepts in various small ways is the price he pays to achieve wholeness and harmony in the whole. (339)

Web design pattern languages?

Real substance vs the image of the substance.

> Society as a whole is felt and experienced most directly within space, and is a product of space. (381)

> If the emotional quality of a building is to be alive, and seen and understood, and felt by the people who live and work there, the process of building it must have this energy. (387)

> I used to judge my apprentices by the extent they were joyfully willing to sweep the floors. (387)

> The emotional energy of a building can be achieved only if the artists who make and shape the building are genuinely responsible for the way the building gets its shape. (393)

> The figures which really occur in nature are only approximations to those ideal forms. (396)

> The unity of the thing depends on a pervasive pattern of linkages and structural interdependencies. (422)

> The extent to which a configuration has life or unity within itself is caused by the geometrical connections among its elements, and also by its relation to its immediate surroundings. (426)

> Every step forward take by the system, will enhance, or preserve the deep structure that it and its surroundings already have. (428)

> Coherent geometry arises from morphogenesis. (429)

The 15 Transformations

1. Strong center
2. Thick boundary
3. Levels of scale
4. Alternating repetition
5. Local symmetries
6. Positive space
7. Roughness

> The roughness that is introduced is created of necessity, because some aspect of the buildings fitness for the site is more important than a perfectionist desire for Cartesian regulaity. (454)

8. Gradient
9. Contrast
10. Deep interlock and ambiguity
11. Echoes
12. Good-shape
13. Inner calm (removal of superfluous structure)
14. Void
15. Not-separateness

> No whole has a hard edge. The boundary defining a whole is always fuzzy or indeterminate. (440)

Reminds me of Watts 'fuzziness'.

> The damage continues to build up, cumulatively, and we experience it daily. All this is happening as a result of actions which are not wholeness enhancing. (442)

> What we see and experience as beauty is a quality in which the world around us is profoundly integrated, deeply interwoven with the feeling of the whole. (455)

> It is in the making of our world that we become alive. (452)

> It is the way or manner in which we make the buildings and the spaces between them that matter most. (476)

> Not love for this person or that person - but love for a small spider who has fallen into a tin can, love for the field which nourishes, and the individual grasses that sway as the breeze comes gently across. (487)

> The ecology of humankind is created by the fabric of buildings, by the human fabric of affection, and by the powerful force of our love for our Earth - love, even for the smallest pebble. (487)
