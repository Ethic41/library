# The Way of Zen
Alan Watts

One who thinks in Chinese has little difficulty in seeing that objects are also events, that our world is a collection of processes rather than entities. (5)

Abstractions and conventional signs are like the cup; they reduce experience to units simple enough to be comprehended one at a time. (7)

There is, then, an analogy - and perhaps more than mere analogy - between central vision and conscious, one-at-a-time thinking, and between peripheral vision and the rather mysterious process which enables us to regulate the incredible complexity of our bodies without thinking at all. It should be noted, further, that we call our bodies complex as a result of trying to understand them in terms of linear thought, of words and concepts. But the complexity is not so much in our bodies as in the task of trying to understand them by this means of thinking. It is like trying to make out the features of a large room with no other light than a single bright ray. It is as complicated as trying to drink water with a fork instead of a cup. (8)

To say that the concrete reality of the human organism *is* physiological is like saying that the earth *is* so many tons or acres. (12)

In other words, the 'rigorously scientific' method of predicting the future can be applied only in special cases - where prompt action is not urgent, where the factors involved are largely mechanical, or in circumstances so restricted as to be trivial. By far the greater part of our important decisions depend upon 'hunch' - in other words, upon the 'peripheral vision' of the mind. Thus the reliability of our decisions rests ultimately upon our ability to 'feel' the situation, upon the degree to which this 'peripheral vision' has been developed. (15)

For experience in making decisions by intuition might well show that this 'peripheral' aspect of the mind works best when we do not try to interfere with it, when we trust it to work by itself - tzu-jan, spontaneously, 'self-so'. (15)

The important difference between the Tao and the usual idea of God is that whereas God produces the world by making (wei), the Tao produces it by not-making (wu-wei) - which is approximately what we mean by growing. For things made are separate parts put together, like machines, or things fashioned from without inwards, like sculptures. Whereas things grown divide themselves into parts, from within outwards. Because the natural universe works mainly according to the principles of growth, it would seem quite odd to the Chinese mind to ask how it was made. If the universe were made, there would of course be someone who knows how it is made - who could explain how it was put together but by but as a technician can explain in one-at-a-time words how to assemble a machine. But a universe which grows utterly excludes the possibility of knowing how it grows in the clumsy terms of thought and language, so that no Taoist would dream of asking whether the Tao knows how it produces the universe. For it operatres according to spontaneity, not according to plan. (16)

For it is really impossible to appreciate what is meant by the Tao without becoming, in a rather special sense, stupid. (19)

The value of emptiness lies in the movements it permits or in the substance which it mediates and contains. (37)

To say, then, that the world of facts and events is maya is to say that facts and events are terms of measurement rather than realities of nature. (39)

The doctrine of maya is therefore a doctrine of relativity. It is saying that things, facts, and events are delineated, not by nature, but by human description, and that the way in which we describe them is relative to our varying points of view. (40)

The maya doctrine points out, firstly the impossibility of grasping the actual world in the mind's net of words and concepts, and secondly, the fluid character of those very forms which thought attempts to define. (43)

Reality it itself is neither permanant nor impermanent; it cannot be categorized. But when one tries to hold on to it, change is everywhere apparent, since, like one's own shadow, the faster one pursues it, the faster it flees. (47)

The ego exists in an abstract sense alone, being an abstraction from memory, somewhat like the illusory circle of fire made by a whirling torch. (47)

The separation of the thinker from the thought, the knower from the known, the subject from the object, is purely abstract. There is not the mind on the hand and its experiences on the other: there is just a process of experiencing in which there is nothing to be grasped, as an object, and no one, as a subject, to grasp it. (53)

*Form is not different from emptiness; emptiness is not different from form. Form is precisely emptiness; emptiness is precisely form.* (64)

Logic and meaning, with its inherent duality, is a property of thought and language but not of the actual world. (73)

The true mind is 'no-mind' (wu-hsin), which is to say that it is not to be regarded as an object of thought or action, as if it were a thing to be grasped and controlled. The attempt to work on one's own mind is a vicious cycle. To try to purify it is to be contaminated with purity. (93)

To succeed is always to fail - in the sense that the more one succeeds in anything, the greater is the need to go on succeeding. To eat is to survive and be hungry. (116)

The illusion of significant improvement arises in moments of contrast, as when one turns from the left to the right on a hard bed. The position is 'better' so long as the contrast remains, but before long the second position begins to feel like the first. (116)

Human experience is determined as much by the nature of the mind and the structure of its senses as by the external objects whose presence the mind reveals. (119)

Our problem is that the power of thought enables us to construct symbols of things apart from the things themselves. This includes the ability to make a symbol, an idea of ourselves apart from ourselves. Because the idea is so much more comprehensible thatn the reality, the symbol so much more stable than the fact, we learn to identify ourselves with our idea of ourselves. (119)

Life is a position of time. (123)

This is not a philosophy of not looking where one is going; it is a philosophy of not making where one is going so much more important than where one is that there will be no point in going. (125)

In walking, just walk. In sitting, just sit. Above all, don't wobble. (135)

The Zen experience is more of a conclusion than a premise. (147)

[Zen] does not confuse spirituality with thinking about God while one is peeling potatoes. Zen spirituality is just to peel the potatoes. (151)

As muddy water is best cleared by leaving it alone, it could be argued that those who sit quietly and do no

Paradoxical as it may seem, the purposeful life has no content, no point. It hurries on and on, and misses everything. Not hurrying, the purposeless life misses nothing, for it is only when there is no goal and no rush that the human senses are fully open to receive the world. (176)

A world which increasingly consists of destinations without journeys between them, a world which values only 'getting somewhere' as fast as possible, becomes a world without substance. One can get anywhere and everywhere, and yet the more this is possible, the less is anywhere and everywhere worth getting to. (197)

The point of the arts is the doing of them rather than the accomplishments. But, more than this, the real joy of them lies in what turns up unintentionally in the course of practice, just as the joy of travel is not nearly so much in getting where one wants to go as in the unsought surprises which occur on the journey. (197)
