The Systems Approach, or Tiki-Taka
===

Gestalt
---
- Always train with the ball.
- The primary element within a systems approach is technical possession.
- Position play evolves naturally from the triangular relationships the short passing game requires.
- Look around every 3-5 seconds, with or without the ball, and give yourself three options, ie, a pass, a first touch, a move into space.
- The first touch, and the first pass are essential.
- Aggressively press high up the pitch, as a unit.

The aim of the possession style of play is to increase the frequency of 3v2 situations. The ball is swung from left to right until gaps appear, which can be exploited. Occassionaly, 1v1's are used sparingly to disrupt the opponents defensive structure, This is usually the wingers responsibility.

Individual emphasis on zonal attitudes, not positional attitude. Players share responsibilities.

### Pressing

Guardiola & Rodgers both utilize the 6s pressing rule, which tends to be when opponents are most vulnerable to pressure. If the ball is not recovered in this time, the team falls back to a controlled, positional press. The triggers for this 2nd phase of press occur either when a player turns back to goal, or when an opponent takes a bad touch.

#### Drills
4v4 Pressing in a small 10x10m grid. 5 passes equals a goal. They'll realize quickly that it's easier to tackle than it is to pass. The difficulty is there because of the compact zone. On a larger pitch, when they lose the ball, they must maintain compact zones so that they can easily win the ball back. On offense, stretch the field.

Quotes

> “I like to control games. I like to be responsible for our own destiny. If you are better than your opponent with the ball you have a 79 per cent chance of winning the game” (Brendan Rodgers)

> “Think quickly, look for spaces. That’s what I do: look for spaces. All day. I’m always looking. All day, all day. Here? No. There? No. People who haven’t played don’t always realise how hard that is. Space, space, space. It’s like being on the PlayStation. I think shit, the defender’s here, play it there. I see the space and pass. That’s what I do.” (Xavi)

> “It’s all about rondos [an advanced version of piggy in the middle]. Rondo, rondo, rondo. Every. Single. Day. It’s the best exercise there is. You learn responsibility and not to lose the ball.” (Xavi)

>“A study in 1988 of 16 international matches showed that possession was won 13% of the time in the attacking third. A staggering 66% of goals scored were from this 13%.” Paul Cooper

> “My template for everything is organisation. With the ball you have to know the movement patterns, the rotation, the fluidity and positioning of the team. Then there’s our defensive organisation…so if it is not going well we have a default mechanism which makes us hard to beat and we can pass our way into the game again. Rest with the ball. Then we’ll build again.” (Rodgers 2012)

> “You win the ball back when there are thirty metres to their goal not eighty” (Guardiola 2009)

> “a full-back who creates is an important part of winning”  Arsène Wenger (2012)

> “the first thing we have in mind is to strive for new courses of action that will not allow the opponent to adapt to our style of play. If an opponent has adjusted himself to our style of play and found a counterplay, then we need to find new a new strategy. That is the dialectic of the game. You have to go forward in such a way and with such a range of attacking options that it will force the opponent to make a mistake. In other words, it’s necessary to force the opponent into the condition you want them to be in. One of the most important means of doing that is to vary the size of the playing area.” Lobanovskyi 

> “Do you know how Barcelona win the ball back so quickly? It’s because they don’t have to run back more than 10 metres as they never pass the ball more than 10 metres.” Johan Cryuff

> Michael Carrick: “Force the opposition to play the ball where you want. Do this by stepping off the player you are marking and drawing them into a pass, then trying to intercept it.”

> “Generally, the most important thing is that they have the same vision [the players]. The ideal coach does not exist; every coach is different and that’s a good thing…however, he must absolutely know the basic principles of coaching and that coaching is more important than winning.” Jan Olde Riekerink (Head of Jong Ajax 2007-11).

### Futsal
### Rondo
In a small grid, play 7v3, 4v2, or 3v1. The important point is that the middle players must learn to press together. Those in possession only have time for 1 or 2 touches.
