Thinking Fast and Slow

Daniel Kahneman

Part 1: Two Systems
---

> System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. (20)

> System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.(21)

> When we think of ourselves, we identify with System 2. (21)

> The often-used phrase "pay attention" is apt: you dispose of a limited budget of attention that you can allocate to activities, and if you try to go beyond your budget, you will fail. (23)

> We can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness. (24)

> Most of what you (your System 2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word. (25)

> Constantly questioning our own thinking would be impossibly tedious, and System 2 is much too slow and inefficient to serve as a substitute for System 1 in making routine decisions. The best we can do is a compromise: *learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high.* (28)

> As you become skilled in a task, its demand for energy diminishes. (35)

> System 1 detects simple relations and excels at integrating information about one thing, but it does not deal with multiple topics at once. (36)

> Switching from one task to another is effortful, especially under time pressure. (37)

> Self-control and deliberate thought apparently draw on the same limited budget of effort. (40)

> Even in the absence of time pressure, maintaining a coherent train of thought requires discipline. (40)

> People who are cognitively busy are also more likely to make selfish choices, use sexist language, and make superficial judgements in social situations. (41)

> One of the main functions of System 2 is to monitor and control thoughts and actions "suggested" by System 1, allowing some to be expressed directly in behavior and suppressing or modifying others. (44)

> Individuals who uncritically follow their intuitions about puzzles are also prone to accept other suggestions from System 1. In particular, they are *impulsive, impatient, and keen to receive immediate gratification.* (48)

> Associate action: ideas that have been evoked trigger many other ideas, in a spreading cascase of activity in your brain. The essential feature of this complex set of mental events is its coherence. Each element is connected, and each supports and strengthens the others. *The word evokes memories, which evoke emotions, which in turn evoke facial expressions* and other reactions, such as a general tensing up and an avoidance tendency. The facial expression and the avoidance motion in intensify the feelings to which they are linked, and the feelings in turn reinforce compatible ideas. (51)

> **Cognition is embodied: you think with with your body, not only with your brain.** (51)

> Simple, common gestures can also unconsciously influence our thoughts and feelings. (54)

> System 1 provides the impressions that often turn into your beliefs, and is the source of the impulses that often become your choices and your actions. (58)

> The experience of cognitive strain tends to mobilize System 2, shifting people's approach to problems from a casual intuitive mode to a more engaged and analytic mode. (65)

> Repetition induces cognitive ease and a comfortable feeling of familiarity *(AKA the Mere Exposure Effect)* (66)

> Mood evidently affects the operation of System 1: when we are uncomfortable and unhappy, we lose touch with our intuition. (69)

> The main function of System 1 is to maintain and update a model of your personal world, which represents what is normal in it. The model is constructed by associateds that link ideas of circumstances, events, actions, and outcomes that co-occur with some regularity, either at the same time or within a relatively short interval. As these links are formed and strengthened, the pattern of associated ideas comes to represent the structure of events in your life, and it determines your interpretation of the present as well as your expectations of the future. (71)

> We *see* causality, just as directly as we see color... We are evidently ready from birth to have impressions of causality, which do not depend on reasoning about patterns of causation. (76)

> Your mind is ready and even eager to identify agents, assign them personality traits and specific intentions, and view their actions as expressing individual propensities. (76)

> System 1 does not keep track of alternatives that it rejects, or even of the fact that there were alternatives. (80)

> People seek data that are likely to be compatible with beliefs they currently hold. (81)

> Sequence matters, however, because the halo effect increases the weight of first impressions. (83)

> When information is scarce, which is a common occurence, System 1 operates as a machine for jumping to conclusions. (85)

> The combination of a coherence-seeking System 1 with a lazy System 2 implies that System 2 will endorse many intuitive beliefs, which closely reflect the impressions generated by System 1. (86)

> It is the consistency of the information that matters for a good story, not its completeness. Indeed, you will often find that knowing little makes it easier to fit everything you know into a coherent pattern. (87)

> The confidence that individuals have in their beliefs depends mostly on the quality of the story they can tell about what they see, even if they see little. (87)

> Good mood and cognitive ease are the human equivalents of assessments of safety and familiarity. (90)

> The normal state of your mind is that you have intuitive feelings and opinions about almost everything that comes your way. (97)

> In the context of attitudes, System 2 is more of an apologist for the emotions of System 1 than a critic of those emotions... Its search for information and arguments is mostly constrained to information that is consistent with existing beliefs, not with an intention to examine them. An active, coherence-seeking System 1 suggests solutions to an undemanding System 2. (104)
