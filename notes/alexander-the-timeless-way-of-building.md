The Timeless Way Of Building
===
Christopher Alexander

It is a process through which the order of a building or a town grows our directly from the inner nature of the people, and the animals, and the plants, and matter which are in it. (7)

...that sleepy, awkward grace which comes from perfect ease. (8)

Although the process is precise, and can be defined in exact terms, finally it becomes valuable, not so much because it shows us things which we don't know, but instead because it shows us what we know already, only daren't admit because it seems so childish, and so primitive. (13)

We have become afraid of what will happen naturally, and convinced that we must work within a 'system', and with 'methods', since without them our surroundings will come tumbling down in chaos. (14)

This is the timeless way, learning the discipline - and shedding it. (15)

Words fail to capture it because it is much more precise than any word... Each word you choose to capture it has fuzzy edges and extensions which blur the central meaning. (29)

Some words used to attempt to define the nameless quality:

- Alive
- Whole
- Comfortable
- Free
- Exact
- Egoless
- Eternal

The quality without a name is never calculated, never perfect; that subtle balance of forces only happens when the idea and images are left behind, and created with abandon. (35)

When a place is lifeless or unreal, there is almost always a mastermind behind it. (36)

The quality which has no name includes these simpler, sweeter qualities. But it is so ordinary as well, that it somehow reminds us of the passing of our life. (40)

[The quality] is, for instance, the wild smile of the gypsies dancing in the road. (47)

This wild freedom, this passion, comes into our lives in the instant we let go. (48)

Our letting go is stifled... so long as we have ideas and opinions about ourselves. (48)

Nothing to keep, nothing to lose. No possessions, no security, no concern about possessions, and no concern about security: in this mood it is possible to do exactly what makes sense, and nothing else. (51)

The conscious effort to attain this quality, or to be free, or to be anything, the glance which this creates, will always spoil it. (52)

All the life and soul of a place, all of our experiences there, depend not simply on the physical environment, but on the patterns of events which we experience there. (62)

The life of a house, or a town, is not given to it, directly, by the shape of its buildings, or by the ornament and plan - it is given to them by the quality of the events and situtations we encounter there. (65)

**Which are the patterns that I personally experience?**

The action and the space are indivisible (70)

The word 'stream' descibes a pattern of physical space and a pattern of events, at the same time. We do not separate the stream bed from the stream. There is no distinction in our minds between the bed of the stream, its banks, its winding configuration, in the land, and the rushing of the water, the growth of plants, the swimming of the fish. (73)

Once we recognize that much of what we think of as an 'element' in fact lies in the pattern of relationships between this thing and the things in the world around it, we then come to the second, even greater realization, that the so-called element is itself nothing but a myth, and that indeed, the element itself is not just embedded in a pattern of relationships, but is itself entirely a pattern of relationships, and nothing else. (88)

**Particularly interesting if you consider this in terms of life, not just architecture.**

The pattern in space is the precondition which allows the pattern of events to happen. (92)

Its goodness comes from the fact that it is true to its own inner forces, not from any special sense of purpose. (117)

Saying these patterns are alive is more or less the same as saying they are stable. (118)

The quality without a name in us, our liveliness, our thirst for life, depends directly on the patterns in the world, and the extent to which they have this quality themselves. Patterns which live, release this quality in us. But they release this quality in us, essentially because they have it in themselves. (122)

**I keep thinking about the Bammans house in Milbridge. Should give them a copy of this book for Christmas.**

There is an indefinable roughness, a looseness, a relaxedness, which nature always has, and this relaxed geometry comes directly from the balance of the repetition and variety. (147)

The repetition of patterns is quite a different thing from the repetition of parts. (150)

A building in which angles are all perfectly right angles, in which all windows are exactly the same size, and in which all columns are perfectly vertical, and all floors perfectly horizontal, can only reach its false perfection by ignoring its surroundings utterly. (152)

The character of nature can't arise without the presence and the consciousness of death. (153)

This quality, when it is reached, in human things, is always sad; it makes us sad; and we can even say that any place where a man tries to make the quality, and be like nature, cannot be true, unless we can feel the slight presence of this haunting sadness there, because we know at the same time we enjoy it, that it is going to pass. (154)

Life cannot be made, only generated by a process (174)

When a person is faced with an act of design, what he does is governed entirely by the pattern language which he has in his mind at the moment. Of course, the pattern languages in each mind are evolving all the time, as each person's experience grows. But at the particular moment he has to make a design, he relies entirely on the pattern language he happens to have accumlated up until that moment. His act of design, whether humble, or gigantically complex, is governed entirely by the patterns he has in his mind at that moment, and his ability to combine these patterns to form a new design. (203)

A pattern language is really nothing more than a precise way of describing someone's experience of building. (207)

The most mystical, most religious, most wonderful - these are not less ordinary than most things - they are more ordinary than most things. (219)

When the language is shared, the individual patterns in the language are profound. (230)

**Reminds me of Tom Macwright's [post](http://www.macwright.org/2012/11/10/microsoft-excel-and-the-folk-tradition-of-technology.html) on Folk traditions.**

Nothing which is not simple and direct can survive the slow transmission from person to person. (230)

So long as I build for myself, the patterns I use will be simple and human, and full of feeling, because I understand my situation. But as soon as a few people begin to build for 'the many', their patterns about what is needed become abstract, no matter how well meaning they are, their ideas gradually get out of touch with reality, because they are not faced daily with the living examples of what the patterns say. (235)

People try to replace the lost order of the organic process by artificial forms of order based on control, but this makes things still worse. (237)

We must make each pattern a thing so that the human mind can use it easily. (267)

**Better yet, give it a name, be able to draw it.**

The pattern is merely a mental image, which can help to predict those situations where forces will be in harmony, and those in which they won't. But the actual forces which will occur in a real situation, although objectively present there, are, in the end, unpredictable, because each situation is so simplex and forces may grow, or die, according to subtle variations of circumstance. (285)

Our feelings always deal with the totality of any system. (289)

Any preconception about the way things ought to be, always interferes with your sense of reality. (303)

The real work of any process of design lies in the task of making up the language. (324)

The key to the improvement of patterns is that fact that it can be piecemeal. (345)

**Alexander talks quite a bit about mimetics. My question is, if 'good patterns' are those which persist, why is our modern architecture so shitty?**

The living form can only be created by a process in which patterns are created and maintained by the people who are a part of them. (354)

There is no sharp difference between the process of construction and the process of repair. (361)

It is not the end product of this process which is alive, but the incessant flux itself. (364)

It is only possible to make a place which is alive by a process in which each part is modified by its position in the whole. (364)

Each part is given its specific form by its existence in the context of the larger whole.

**Watts fuzzy edges.**

The process of development is, in essence, a sequence of operations, each one of which differentiates the structure which has been laid down by the previous operations. (371)

**Is this functional programming?**

The character of nature is not something added to a good design. (384)

Do not consciously try to create the pattern. If you do this, the images and ideas in your mind will distort it, will begin to take over, and the pattern itself will never make its way into the world: instead, there will be a 'design'. (396)

When the spider builds its web, the process is standardized, but the parts which are created are all different. (463)

In a life which is truly lived, there are moments which are 'in between', or 'out of life' - every moment is lived fully. (484)

The small patterns produced directly by the individuals and repeated over and over again. The large patterns generated indirectly, by the gradual incremental repetition of the smaller patterns. (508)

'It' is vastly more complex than any other kind of order. 'It" cannot be created by decision. It cannot be designed. It cannot be predicted in a plan. It is the living testament of hundred and thousands of people, making their own lives and all their inner forces manifest. (510)

The straight walls are not perfectly straight, because there is no reason for them to be perfect. (521)

Each thing is made of parts, but the parts overlap and interlock to such an extent that the oneness of all things becomes more marked.

**Again, Watts Fuzzyness.**

We can only make a bulding live when we are egoless. (535)

Instead, you must start with nothing in your mind. (538)

So long as you are using patterns slavishly, mechanically, they will interfere with your sense of reality, as much as any other images. You will be able to use them properly only at the moment when you have the proper disregard for them. (542)

There is no skill required. It is only a question of whether you will allow yourself to be ordinary. (547)
