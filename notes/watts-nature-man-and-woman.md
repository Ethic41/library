# Nature, Man and Woman
Alan Watts

Discussion is so much a matter of juggling with categories that to start breaking up the categories is to break up the discussion, (ix)

The harsh divisions of spirit and nature, mind and body, subject and object, controller and controlled are seen more and more to be awkward conventions of language. (4)

We have less and less use for words which denote stuggs, entities, and substances, for mind and matter have disappeared into process. (4)

Things have become events, and we think of them in terms of pattern, configuration, or structure. (4)

The formally static character of our words for feelings conceals the fact that our feelings are directions rather than states. (34)

Political order is, then, different in principle from organic orgder, wherein the parts constitute a whole by nature as distince from force or persuasion. (49)

The terms, the Euclidean points, ends, and boundaries, are everything, and the context nothing. (50)

The fundamental realities of nature are not, as thought construes them, separate things. (57)

Since is... an aware of nature based upon the selective, analytic, and abstractice way of focusing attention. (59)

At each moment she starts upon a long, long journey and at each moment she reaches her end... All is eternally present in her, for she knows neither past nor future. For her, the present is eternity. (69) - *From Goethe's ['Fragment on Nature'](http://home.earthlink.net/~johnrpenner/Articles/goethe-nature.html)*

Narrowed, serial consciousness, the memory-stored stream of impressions, is the means by which we have the sense of ego. (70)

*Kuan* is, then, simply to observe silently, openly, and without seeking any particular result. (74)

*Kuan* is not so much a mind empty of contents as a mind empty of mind. (77)

Between subject and object, organism and environment, yang and yin, is the balancing and homeostatic relationship called Tao - intellgent not because it has an ego, but because it has *li*, organic pattern. (91)

The realization that nature is ordered organically, rather than politically, that it is a field of relationships rather than a collection of things, requires an appropriated mode of human awareness. (95)

Spontaneity is, after all, total sincerity. (112)

The bewildering complexity of nature is a dance with no destination other than the figures now in performance, figures improvised not in response to an overruling law but mutually to each other. (124)

A certain amount of ordinary laziness would lend our culture the pleasant mellowness which it singularly lacks. (126)

When man is not pursuing something outside himself, he is action expressing its own fullness, whether weeping for sorrow or jumping for joy. (128)

*"Fura-fura"*, the flapping of a cloth in the breeze, or the motion of an empty gourd in a bubbling river. (128)

When we stand with our nature, seeing that there is nowhere to stand against it, we are at last able to move unmoved. (136)

The world is not unlike a vast, shapeless Rorshach but which we read according to our inner disposition. (140)

When the mounting excitement is accepted rather than grasped, it becomes a full realization of spontaneity, and the resulting orgasm is not its sudden end but the bursting in upon us of peace. (158)

The whole is a pattern which remains, while the parts come and go... The pattern does not exist disembodiedly apart from individual forms, but exists precisely through thir coming and going. (185)

We must see that consciousness is neither an isolated soul nor the mere function of a single nercous system, but of that totality of interrelated stars and galaxies which makes a nervous system possible. (186)

It is in the living organism that the whole world feels, it is only by virtue of eyes that the stars themselves are light. (186)

The rift between God and nature would vanish if we knew how to experience nature, because what keeps them apart is not a difference of substance but a split in the mind. (189)
