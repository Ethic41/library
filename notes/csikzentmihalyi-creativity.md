# Creativity
Mihaly Csikzentmihalyi

It is not surprising that as we ride the crest of evolution we have taken over the title of creator. Whether this transformation will help the human race or cause its downfall is not yet clear. It would help if we realized the awesome responsibility of this new role. (5)

Creativity results from the interaction of a system composed of three elements: a culture that contains symbolic rules, a person who brings novelty into the symbolic domain, and a field of experts who recognize and validate the innovation. (6)

Creativity... is a process by which a symbolic domain in the culture is changed. (8)

Over an entire lifetime, the amount of attention left over for learning a symbolic domain -- such as music or physics -- is a fraction of this small amount [of time we have to live]. (8)

Creativity generally involves crossing the boundaries of domains. (9)

[Since] social confirmation is necessary for something to be called creative, the definition must encompass more than the individual. (25)

Perhaps the most important implication of the systems model is that the level of creativity in a given place at a given time does not depend only on the amount of individual creativity. It depends just as much on how well suited the respective domains and fields are to the recognition and diffusion of novel ideas. (31)

It is because of this inseparable connection that creativity must... be seen not as something happening within a person, but in the relationships within a system. (36)

each domain describes an isolated little world in which a person can think and act with clarity and concentration. (37)

Despite the multiplicity of domains, there are some comon reasons for pursuing them for their own sake. Nuclear physics, microbiology, poetry, and musical composition share few symbols and rules, yet the calling for these different domains is often astonishingly similar. _To bring order to experience, to make something that will endure after one's death, to do something that allows humankind to go beyond its present powers are very common themes. When asked why he decided to become a poet at the age of seven, Gyorgy Faludy answered 'Because I was afraid to die'._ (38)

the competition between memes, or units of cultural information, is as fierce as the competition between the units of chemical information we call genes. (41)

Because of the scarcity of attention, we must be selective. (42)

This competition also means that a creative person must convince the field that he or she has made a valuable innovation. (42)

Fields can affect the rate of creativity in at least three ways... A reactive field does not solicit or stimulate novelty, while a proactive field does... The second way for the field to influence the rate of novelty is by choosing either a narrow or a broad filter in the selection of novelty... Finally, fields can encourage novelty if they are well connected to the rest of the social system and are able to channel support into their own domain. (43)

Perhaps being creative is more like being involved in an automobile accident... Accidents, like creativity, are properties of systems rather than of individuals. (45)

Luck is without doubt an important ingredient in creative discoveries. (46)

A person who wants to make a creative contribution not only must work withing a creative system but must also reproduce that system within his or her mind. (47)

'You cannot think only of good ideas, or write only beautiful music. You must thinkg of a lot of music, a lot of ideas, a lot of poetry, a lot of whatever. And if you're good, you must be able to throw out the junk immediately without even saying it.' - Jacob Rabinow (49)

Openness to experience, a fluid attention that constantly processes events in the environment, is a great advantage for recognizing potential novelty. (53)

Someone who is not known and appreciated by the relevant people has a very difficult time accomplishing something that will be seen as creative. (54)

If I had to express in one word what makes [creative people's] personalities different from others, it would by complexity. By this I mean that they show tendencies of thought and action that in most people are segregated. They contrain contradictory extremes -- instead of being an 'individual,' each of them is a 'multitude.' (57)

The rhythm of activity followed by idleness or reflection [is] considered very important for the success of [a creative person's] work. (58)

Naivete is the most important attribute of a genius. (60)

Great art and great science involve a leap of imagination into a world that is different from the present. The rest of society often views these new ideas as fantasies without relevance to current reality. (63)

Creative individuals are also remarkably humble and proud at the same time... Their respect for the domain in which they work makes them aware of the long line of previous contributions to it, which puts their own into perspective. Second, they are also aware of the role that luck played in their own achievements. (68)

A physcologically androgynous person in effect doubles his or her repertoire of responses and can interact with the world in terms of a much wider and varied spectrum of opportunities. (71)

Perhaps the most important quality, the one that is most consistently present in all creative individuals, is the ability to enjoy the process of creation for its own sake. (75)

The creative process has traditionally been described as taking five steps. The first is a period of preparation, becoming immersed, consciously or not, in a set of problematic issues that are interesting and arouse curiosity... The second phase of the creative process is a period of incubation, during which ideas churn around below the threshold of consciousness... The third component of the creative process is insight... The fourth component is evaluation, when the person must decide whether the insight is valuable and worth pursuing. The fifth and last component of the process is elaboration. It is probably the one that takes up the most time and involves the hardest work. [However], _the creative process is less linear than recursive. How many iterations it goes through, how many loops are involved, how many insights are needed, depends on the depth and breadth of the issues dealt with._ (79)

There are three main sources from which problems typically arise: personal experiences, requirements of the domain, and social pressures. (83)

Without a burning curiousity, a lively interest, we are unlikely to persevere long to make a significant new contribution. (87)

When a field becomes too self-referential and cut off from reality, it runs the risk of becoming irrelevant. It is often dissatisfaction with the rigidity of domains that makes great creative advances possible. (89)

_Impara l'arte, e metille da parta_ (learn the craft, and then set it aside). One cannot be creative without learning what others know, but then one cannot be creative without becoming dissatisfied with that knowledge and rejecting it for a better way. (90)

Present problems usually take a much shorter time to prepare for and to solve than discovered problems. (97)

 It is important to let problems simmer below the threshold of consciousness for a time. (98)

Something similar to parallel processing may be taking place when the elements of a problem are said to be incubating. When we think consciously about an issue, our previous training and the effort to arrive at a solution push our ideas in a linear direction, usually along predictable or familiar lines. But intentionality does not work in the subconscious. (102)

After an insight occurs, one must check it out to see if the connections genuinely make sense... Most lovely insights never go any farther, because under the cold light of reason, fatal flaws appear. (104)

Creative persons differ from one another in a variety of ways, but in one respect they are unanimous: They all love what they do. (107)

The flow experience was described in almost identical terms regardless of the activity that produced it... 

- There are clear goals every step of the way. 
- There is immediate feedback to one's actions. 
- There is a balance between challenges and skills. 
- Action and awareness are merged. One pointedness of mind is required by the close match between challenges and skills, and it is made possible by the clarity of goals and the constant availability of feedback.
- Distractions are excluded from consciousness.
- There is no worry of failure.
- Self-consciousness disappears. In flow we are too involved in what we are doing to care about protecting the ego. Paradoxically, the self expands through acts of self-forgetfulness.
- The sense of time becomes distorted.
- The activity becomes autotelic (something that is end in itself.) In many ways, the secret to a happy life is to learn to get flow from as many of the things we have to do as possible. If work and family life become autotelic, then there is nothing wasted in life, and everything we do is worth doing for its own sake. (110)

'Well, I think that you have to describe it as sort of a struggle. I have to always force myself to write, and also to work harder at a science problem. You have to put blood, sweat, and tears into it first. And it is awfully hard to get started. I think most writers have this problem. I mean, it's part of the business. You may work very hard for a week producing the first page. That's really blood, tears, and sweat, and there is nothing else to describe it. You have to force yourself to push and push and push with the hope that something good will come out. And you have to go through that process before it really starts to flow easily, and without that prelimary forcing and pushing probably nothing would ever happen. So, I think that is what distinguishes it from just have a good time -- you have a good time once you are really in the flowing phase, but you have to overcome some sort of barrier to get there. That is why I say it is unconscious, because you really don't know actually whether you are really getting anywhere or now. In that phare, it just seems to be unadulterated torture.' - Freeman Dyson (107)

'At your best you're not thinking, how am I making my way ahead in the world by doing this? No. You're concentrated on your characters, on the situation, on the form of the book, on the words which are coming out. And their shape. You've lost... you're not an ego at that point. It's not competitive. It's... I would use the word pure. You know that this is right. I don't mean that it works in the world, or that it adds up, but that it's right in this place. In this story. It belongs to it. It's right for that person, that character.' - Richard Stern (119)

'Well, you're right in the work, you lose your sense of time, you're completely enraptured, you're completely caught up in what you're doing, and you're sort of swayed by the possibilities you see in this work. If that becomes too powerful, then you get up, because the excitement is too great. You can't continue to work or continue to see the end of the work because you're jumping ahead of yourself all the time. _The idea is to be so... so saturated with it that there's no future or past, it's just an extended present in which you're, uh, making meaning_. And dismantling meaning, and remarking it. Without undue regard for the words you're using. It's meaning carried to a high order. It's not just essential communication, daily communication; it's a total communication. When you're working on something and you're working well, you have the feeling that there's no other way of saying what you're saying.' - Mark Strand (121)

'It interests me. It is a source of satisfaction. Acheiving something that one thinks is important. Without such a consciousness or motivation it seems to me that life could be rather dull and purposeless, and I wouldn't want to attempt that kind of life. Of complete leisure, say, of having absolutely nothing to do that one felt was worth doing -- that strikes me as a rather desperate situation to be in.' - C. Vann Woodward (123)

The place where one lives is important for three main reasons. The first is that one must be in a position to access the domain in which one plans to work. The second reason... is that novel simulation is not evenly distributed. Finally, access to the field is not evenly distributed in space. (128)

When ordinary people are signaled with an electronic pager at random times of the day and asked to rate how creative they feel, they tend to report the highest lveels of creativity when walking, driving, or swimming; in other words, when involved in a semiautomatic activity that takes up a certain amount of attention, while leaving some of it free to make connections among ideas below the threshold of conscious intentionality. Devoting full attention to a problem is not the best recipe for having creative thoughts. (138)

When we think intentionally, thoughts are forced to follow a linear, logical direction. But when attention is focused on the view during a walk, part of the brain is left free to pursue associations that normally are not made. (138)

Personalizing patterns of action helps to free the mind from the expectations that make demands on attention and allows intense concentration on matters that count. (145)

Creative individuals seem to have had either exceptionally supportive childhoods or very deprived and challenging ones... Many creative individuals come from quite poor origins and many from professional or upper-class ones; very few were hailed from the great middle class. (171)

After curiousity, this quality of concentrated attention is what creative individuals mention most often as having set them apart in college from their peers. (185)

Creative individuals don't have careers; they create them. (193)

'When some people at my age ask me what to do, I say, "You must have an obsession." You must always have too little time instead of too much.' - Eva Zeisel (207)

Freud's simple answer to an inquiry about the secret for a happy life: 'Love and work.' (227)

A person aspiring to wisdom knows that the bottom line of a well-lived life is not so much success but the certainty we reach, in the most private fibers of our being, that our existence is linked in a meaningful way with the rest of the universe. (223)

The written word allows us to understand better whta is happening within ourselves... Fragile thoughts and feelings are transformed by words into concrete thoughts and emotions. (238)

The secret of saying something new is to be patient. If one reacts too quickly, it is  likely that the reaction will be superficial, a cliche... Yet life is short, so patience is painful. (240)

Attention coils and uncoils, its focus sharpens and softens, like the systolic and diastolic beat of the heart. (242)

'In every art, you have to be your own critic. If you get up to a real good standard, you have to be both the one who writes and the one who corrects at the same time.' - Hilde Domin (248)

Paradoxically, it is the abstract rules we invent to limit and focus our attention that give us the experience of untrammeled freedom. (250)

Assimilating the style of predecessors is necessary before one can develop one's own. Only by immersing oneself in the domain can one find out whether there is room left for contributing creatively to it, and whether one is capable of doing so. (252)

'Human beings are the only creatures who are allowed to fail. If an ant fails, it's dead. But we're allowed to learn from our mistakes and from our failures. And that's how I learn, by falling flat on my face and picking myself up and starting all over again. If I'm not free to fail, I will never start another book, I'll never start a new thing.' - Madeleine L'Engle (258)

'To understand is to forgive' - Pascal (261)

The tendency to take one's dreams and hunches seriously and to see patterns where others see meaningless confusion is clearly one of the most important traits that separates creative individuals from otherwise equally competent peers. (288)

'The real worth of nations are ecosystem resources and intelligent, problem-solving, creative people' - Hazel Henderson (300)

It does not take much thought to realize that the main threats to our survival as a species, the very problems we hope creativity will solve, were brought about by yesterday's creative solutions. (318)

...computer literacy is more a question of learning to be a consumer of information than knowing how to generate or use the information acquired. (321)

The more well-off we become, the less reason we have to look for change, and hence the more exposed we are to outside forces. The result of creativity is often its own negation. (321)

In terms of using mental energy creatively, perhaps the most fundamental difference between people consists in how much uncommitted attention they have left over to deal with novelty... In a person concerned with protecting his or her self, practically all the attention is invested in monitoring threats to the ego. (345)

To free up creative energy we need to let go and divert some attention from the pursuit of the predictable goals that our genes and memes have programmed in our minds and use it instead to explore the world around us on its own terms. (346)

One of the surest ways to enrich life is to make experiences less fleeting, so that the most memorable, interesting, and important events are not lost forever a few hours after they occured. (347)

Taking refuge in passive entertainment keeps chaos temporarily at bay, but the attention it absorbs gets wasted. (348)

Cultivating flow entails:

- If you do anything well, it becomes enjoyable.
- Wake up in the morning with a specific goal to look forward to.
- To keep enjoying something, you nede to increase its complexity.
- Take charge of your schedule.
- Make time for reflection and relaxation.
- Find out what you like and what you hate about life. The first step toward self-knowledge involves having a clear idea of what you spend your life doing and how you feel while doing it.
- Start doing more of what you love, less of what you hate.
- Develop what you lack.
- Produce as many ideas as possible. (349)
