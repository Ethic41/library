# Happiness revisited

- Happiness is sought by everyony.
- Other goals sought only if expected to increase happiness.
- It depends on how we interpret events.
- Optimal experience is the result of strenuous mental and physical activity, not passive.
- Happiness through control of one's inner life.

> When people try to achieve happiness on their own, without the support of a faith, they seek to maximize pleasures that are programmed into their dreams or are attractive in their society.

- Myths and beliefs transform randomness into understandable problems.
- Lack of inner order yields existential dread.
- Our world; affluent, scientific, sophisticated, in itself, doesn't make us happy.
- One must be able to provide rewards for themself.
- A thoroughly socialized person is one who desires only the rewards others have agreed he should long for.
- Control of consciousness determines quality of life.

# Anatomy of consciousness

- Consciousness is the result of biological processes.
- Consciousness has the ability to overide genetic programming.
- The difference between dreams and reality is that we can control our mind in reality. One cannot act.
- Consciousness -> subjectively experienced reality.
- Intentions -> force that keeps information in consciousness ordered.
- Manifestation of intentionality -> instinct, need, drive, desire.
- Consciousness can be ordered in terms of different goals and intentions.
- One can process at most 126 bits of information per second.
- Understanding what someone is saying consumes 40 bps.
- **The information we allow into consciousness determines the content and quality of life.**
- Information enters our consciousness because we intend to focus on it or because of attentional habits.
- Attention determines what will or will not appear in consciousness.
- The self represents the hierarchy of foals we build up over the years.
- Information that threatens consciousness' goals causes psychic entropy.
- Flow, where information agrees with the selfs goals, feels extremely positive.
- Following a flow experience, the organization of the self is more complex.
- Increased complexity leads to growth.

# Enjoyment and the quality of life

- Requires environmental modification and a change in interpretation of events.
- Happiness: how we feel about ourselves and what happens to us.
- Pleasure is a content feeling acheived when information in our consciousness says that bio or social expectations have been met.
- Pleasure cannot create new complexity.
- Enjoyment: pleasure and achievement of something unexpected.

## 8 components of enjoyment

1. occurs when we have a chance of completing a task
2. be able to concentrate
3. clear goals
4. immediate feedback
5. removes one from the awareness of other issues
6. sense of self control
7. concern for self dissappears
8. sense of duration of time is altered.

# The conditions of flow.

## 4 broad categories of games

1. agon - competition, sports
2. alea - games of chance
3. ilinx - games that altern consciousness
4. mimicry - creation of alternate realities

- flow and religion are connected
- contemporary flow activities are secularized, and cannot link actor to any powerful meaning system. content is hedonic.
- modern 'religion': supply and demand, class conflict, sociobiology, behaviorism
- freely chosen and intimate flow activities more precisely indicate who we are
- maybe one society is better than another if a greater number of people can access experiences in line with their goals
- once practices and beliefs become societal norms, people assume thats how things must be
- cultures are defensive structures against chaos, and are simple adaptive responses to the environment
- flow might be a powerful motivator, but in does not guarantee virtue

To increase the chances one has of experiencing flow:

1. must be able to focus attention
2. no excessive self-consciousness
3. no self-centeredness

- context supporting flow: clarity, centering, choice, commitment, challenge
- most important trait of autotelicsL a strongly directed purpose that isn't self-seeking

## The body in flow

- the easiest step toward improving quality of life is to control the body and its senses
- people pursuing leaisure activity expensive in outside resources were less happy than in cheaper ones
- sex as flow
- eroticisim is to sex as sport is to physical activity
- notice and pay attention to everything. Make everything a potential flow experience by critically examinging what it is you are doing.

## The flow of thought

- entropy is the normal state of consciousness, a condittion neither useful or enjoyable.
